# Round rules

## Flow of an round

An round begins at the base and ends at the base after all teams have completed their runs. Teams start at staggered times, and each team's rendezvous are timed to follow one another. The contact frequency is thus available to one team at a time.

The time sequence of a run is as follows:

For each team:

- 5 minutes before the start: the team receives a map of the surroundings and can choose a strategy for its course.
- 0:00 start
- 0:15 to 0:20 (1st *rendezvous*)
- 0:30 to 0:35 (2nd *rendezvous*)
- 0:45 to 0:50 (3rd *rendezvous*)
- 0:55 to 1:00 (bonus *rendezvous*)
- 1:00 end of regulation time
- 1:05 final deadline for return to base
- 1:05-1:15 debriefing

Teams move around and transmit 3-word code code from different locations to the base to draw the largest possible polygon around it.

The timing of the round is set by the operator, who announces by radio once a minute the time remaining and the name of the team with the next appointment (hereinafter heartbeat). This allows teams to check whether they are still within range.

The operator announces the start of an appointment. Teams can call as soon as they are ready. The operator initiates a *contact* by giving the floor to one of the teams calling with the words "Team XXX, over to you". The *team* must transmits its 3-word code. The base station repeats the words received in the radio alphabet to confirm. The team must acknowledge. The base closes a *contact* by transmitting the words "base listening". It is then immediatly available for the next team. in this way, the contact window for the next team is extended accordingly.

## End of round

A team must present itself in full at the base no later than 5 minutes after the end of the official end time. A late arrival will result in a penalty for each team member missing. Please note, that the official end time is staggered between the teams depending on the order they started. Every teams has the same amount of time for the run.
