# Scores

Team scores are calculated from the area of the polygon delimited by the contacts made by a team. At least 3 contacts are required to score points.

The match is played in 2 rounds. The scores for each round are:

- four contacts = 4 points
- three contacts = 3 points
- two contacts = 2 points
- 1 contact or no contact = no points

If, at the end of the 2 rounds, the teams are tied on points, the tie is broken by adding up all the areas in their territories.

## Penalties

3 penalties are equivalent to a 10% reduction in conquered area.

A team receives a penalty in the following cases:

- a team member fails to return to base on time after the last rendezvous. If the team has 4 members, this is equivalent to 4 penalties.
