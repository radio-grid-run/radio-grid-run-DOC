# Contact rules

## Contact sequence

Teams send the w3w code of different locations to the base to draw the largest possible polygon around it.

A *contact* must take place as follows to be validated:

1) the valid w3w code is received by the base station
2) transmission has taken place during authorized appointments
3) *the team is not allowed to move during the entire contact time*.
4) To prove that they are at the correct location, the team provides a screenshot of the w3w application to the referee with the corresponding 3-word code and the time corresponding to the contact.
5) The team has filled in its route sheet completely and legibly.

The referee is the sole judge of whether a contact is valid.

## Transmit position

The team's coordinates are transmitted in the form of a 3-word code. It corresponds to a what3word [https://what3words.com](https://what3words.com) provided by a free application on the participants' cell phones. Example:

    ///co√©diteur.visitant.paradisiaque

The latter corresponds to the position of a scout refuge (46.931207,7.022492). Each code corresponds to three 3-metre x 3-metre squares somewhere on the planet's surface. Two of these three matches can be easily eliminated by plausibility. For example, the above-mentioned locator also refers to one square in the Sahel desert and the other in the North Pacific. Accepting this additional operation reduces the vocabulary needed to code 3 words for the entire surface of the globe.
