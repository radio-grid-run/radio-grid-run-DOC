# Equipment

The equipment used for transmissions is PMR 446Mhz and max 0.5W transmitting power.

## Teams are responsible for their own equipment

- a walkie-talkie (PMR446) with **fully charged battery** TODO: determine the frequency range to be used (LDP, PMR traditional channels or PMR new channels)
- Cell phone per team with **fully charged battery**, data connection, mapping application [what3words](https://what3words.com/products/what3words-app) installed.
- Writing utensils (pencil)

Note: *the team is responsible for ensuring that the equipment is operational for the duration of the match. This includes data connection, device batteries and prior installation of the cartography app.

## Material to be prepared by the organization

- Printed map of the playing area for each team (for strategy)
- Computer to count the surface area of each team's territory at the end of the game. The python script [rgrHelper](https://github.com/radio-grid-run/rgrHelper) is designed specifically for this purpose. Be aware the [https://developer.what3words.com/public-api](what3words public api) is only free until a certain number of API calls per month. It should be enough to play, but while testing and developping the limit can be easily reach.
- As many stopwatches as there are teams for the referee.

## Optional equipment

- Teams can use a stopwatch to obtain precise timing information for the round.
- Recording game frequency communications helps resolve disputes and possible misunderstandings between base and team.
