## Politeness in communication

The spirit of communication must be polite. At all times, teams must ensure that exchanges run smoothly. Teams must announce themselves for each transmission. If a signal is transmitted without identification with the aim of blocking the frequency or for any other reason deemed to be anti-gambling, the referee may hand out a penalty to the offending team.

The operator and referee ensure that teams have sufficient time to establish contact during an appointment, even if this means continuing contact beyond the normal duration of an appointment.
