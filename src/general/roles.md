# Roles

## Operator

The base operator counts down the time remaining until the next appointment. He gives the floor to the teams equally during the appointment. Repeats the 3-word code code received to validate in [international phonetic alphabet](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_phon%C3%A9tique_de_l%27OTAN).

## Log manager

The logger accompanies the operator to the base. He keeps the run time up to date (choronometer) and fills in the base log.

## Referee

The referee listens to the radio exchanges from any point on the field and ensures that the rules are respected. At the end of the game, he reports on the quality of transmissions. A protest can be lodged with the referee if a team or the base has behaved in an anti-game manner on the air, or if a team has moved during its transmission.

Recording game frequency communications helps resolve disputes and possible misunderstandings between base and team.

## Team member

A team member may call the base to give his or her position during appointments. *During the call, he/she is forbidden to move*. At the end of the last scheduled appointment, he has a limited time to return to base with his entire team.
